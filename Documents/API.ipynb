      "0  Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Anti-Insulin Aspart Antibodies (AIAs), AIA was categorized as: treatment-induced AIA, treatment-boosted AIA, and treatment-emergent AIA. Treatment-induced AIAs: participants who developed AIA following investigational medicinal product (IMP) administration (participants with at least one positive AIA sample at any time during on-treatment period, in those participants without pre-existing AIA or with missing Baseline sample). Treatment-boosted AIAs: participants with pre-existing AIAs that were boosted to a significant higher titer following IMP administration (participants with at least one AIA sample with at least a 4-fold increase in titers compared to Baseline value at any time during on-treatment period, in those participants with pre-existing AIA). Participants with treatment-emergent AIA were defined as participants with treatment-induced, or treatment-boosted AIAs. On-treatment period was defined as the time from the first injection of IMP up to the last injection of IMP + 1 day., From first injection of IMP (Day 1) up to 1 day after the last injection of IMP (i.e., up to Day 113)|Number of Participants With at Least One Hypoglycemic Event, Severe hypoglycemia: event in which participant required assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions, because participant was not capable of helping self. Documented symptomatic hypoglycemia: event in which typical symptoms of hypoglycemia (SOH) were accompanied by measured plasma glucose concentration (PGC) less than or equal to (\\<=) 3.9 millimoles per liter (mmol/L)(\\<70 milligrams per deciliter \\[mg/dL\\]) or \\<3.0 mmol/L(\\<54 mg/dL). Asymptomatic hypoglycemia: event without SOH and with measured PGC of \\<=3.9 mmol/L (\\<70 mg/dL) or \\<3.0 mmol/L (\\<54 mg/dL). Probable symptomatic hypoglycemia: event with SOH not accompanied by plasma glucose determination but was presumably caused by PGC \\<=3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL). Relative hypoglycemia: event with SOH but with measured PGC greater than (\\>) 3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL)., From first injection of IMP (Day 1) up to 1 day after the last injection of IMP (i.e., up to Day 113)|Number of Hypoglycemic Events Per Participant-year, Number of hypoglycemia events (any, severe, documented \\[both threshold\\], asymptomatic \\[both threshold\\], probable symptomatic and relative) per participant-year of exposure were reported. Severe hypoglycemia: event in which participant required assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions, because participant wasn't capable of helping self. Documented symptomatic hypoglycemia: event in which typical SOH were accompanied by measured PGC of \\<=3.9 mmol/L (\\<70 mg/dL) or \\<3.0 mmol/L(\\<54 mg/dL). Asymptomatic hypoglycemia: event without SOH and measured PGC of \\<=3.9 mmol/L (\\<70 mg/dL) or \\<3.0 mmol/L(\\<54 mg/dL). Probable symptomatic hypoglycemia: event with SOH not accompanied by plasma glucose determination but was presumably caused by PGC \\<=3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL). Relative hypoglycemia: event with SOH but with measured PGC \\>3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL)., From first injection of IMP (Day 1) up to 1 day after the last injection of IMP (i.e., up to Day 113)|Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Treatment-emergent Serious Adverse Events (TESAEs), An Adverse Event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug and did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: resulted in death, was life-threatening, required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/ incapacity, was a congenital anomaly/birth defect, was a medically important event. TEAEs were defined as AEs that developed, worsened or became serious during the on-treatment period (from first injection of IMP up to 1 day after the last injection of IMP)., From first injection of IMP (Day 1) up to 1 day after the last injection of IMP (i.e., up to Day 113)|Pharmacokinetics: Time to Reach Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Tmax) of Insulin Aspart Following Administration of Either SAR341402 (Switching Arm) or NovoLog (Non-switching Arm), Tmax was defined as the time taken to reach the maximum observed plasma concentration.
